They are made using [Oomox tool](https://github.com/actionless/oomox)

To install just:
1. Download zip
1. Upack zip
1. Copy to ~/.themes `cd Gtk3Themes-master && cp -r * ~/.themes`
1. Then copy to system `sudo cp -r * /usr/share/themes`
1. Some clean up: `sudo rm /usr/share/themes/LICENSE && rm ~/.themes/LICENSE`
1. Change to new theme :D
